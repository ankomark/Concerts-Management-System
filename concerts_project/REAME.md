#  Concerts Management System
The Concerts Management System is a Python-based project using SQLAlchemy to manage concerts, bands, and venues. The system supports adding new concerts, viewing concerts by bands or venues, and implementing soft delete functionality for bands. Additionally, it includes a variety of query methods for finding concerts based on band names or dates.

# Features
Bands: Add, query, and soft delete bands.
Venues: Add and query venues.
Concerts: Add, query, and validate concerts with a band and venue.
Soft Delete: Implement soft delete functionality by adding a deleted_at timestamp to bands.
Relationships: SQLAlchemy relationships between Bands, Venues, and Concerts.
Querying: Query concerts by band name or date.
Technologies
Python 3.x
SQLAlchemy
SQLite (default database)
# Project Structure
bash
Copy code
concerts_project/
│
├── models.py            # Contains SQLAlchemy models (Band, Venue, Concert)
├── main.py              # The main script to interact with the system
├── migrations/          # Database migrations and schema setup
├── README.md            # This file (project documentation)

# Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/concerts_project.git
cd concerts_project
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up the Database
Before running the application, you'll need to create and apply migrations to set up the database.

bash
Copy code
# Initialize the SQLite database with migrations
alembic upgrade head
Usage
# 1. Running the Project
To interact with the system, simply run the main.py file.

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will allow you to add bands, venues, and concerts, and execute queries for concerts based on band names or dates.

# 2. Example Usage
Here are some example operations you can perform within the main.py script:

Add a Band
python
Copy code
band1 = Band(name="The Rolling Stones", hometown="London")
session.add(band1)
session.commit()
Add a Venue
python
Copy code
venue1 = Venue(title="Wembley Stadium", city="London")
session.add(venue1)
session.commit()
Schedule a Concert
python
Copy code
concert1 = band1.add_concert(venue1, "2024-09-20")
session.add(concert1)
session.commit()
Find Concerts by Band
python
Copy code
concerts = Band.find_concerts(session, "The Rolling Stones")
for concert in concerts:
    print(concert.date, concert.venue.title)
Soft Delete a Band
python
Copy code
band1.soft_delete()
session.commit()
# Database Models
# 1. Band Model
Represents musical bands and has a relationship with concerts.

id: Primary Key
name: Name of the band (unique)
hometown: Hometown of the band
deleted_at: Timestamp to mark soft deletion
Methods:
soft_delete(): Soft delete a band by marking the deleted_at timestamp.
add_concert(venue, date): Adds a concert for the band at a given venue.
find_concerts(session, band_name): Finds all concerts for a given band.
# 2. Venue Model
Represents venues where concerts take place.

id: Primary Key
title: Name of the venue (unique)
city: City where the venue is located
# 3. Concert Model
Represents concerts linking a band and a venue on a specific date.

id: Primary Key
date: Date of the concert (mandatory)
band_id: Foreign key linking to the Band model
venue_id: Foreign key linking to the Venue model
Methods:
validate_date(): Validates the date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
search_by_date(session, date): Finds all concerts for a given date.
Future Improvements
Implement an API for interacting with the system via HTTP requests.
Extend the querying functionality to include searching by city or venue.
Add user authentication to protect concert management.
Integrate Flask or FastAPI to create a web-based user interface.
Introduce unit tests to test the models and methods more rigorously.
